3a. A search strategy is complete when it is always able to find a solution, as long it exists.
3b. Yes, our search strategy always finds a solution, in every different kind of maze, because it visits all different
states until it encounters the goal
3c. No, once our search strategy reaches the goal, it stops searching for different routes. Because there sometimes are
multiple routes towards the goal, it isn’t always guaranteed that the solution found is the shortest.
3d. The exploration order is what you’d expect from a depth-first search: when the search reaches a dead end, it goes
back to the previous node, and takes the other route. Because of this, Pac-Man doesn’t visit all explored squares, as
some squares don’t lead towards the goal.
