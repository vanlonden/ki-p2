B)  Game.py has a couple of classes: Agent, Directions, AgentState, Configuration, Grid, GameStateData and Game.
    The Game classes manages the control flow. It uses the input of controls to navigate the character and update the game. For this it uses the classes
    GameState, AgentState and Grid.
    The AgentState Class holds the state of the agent. This regards its speed and configuration but also which character the it processes. It uses the
    configuration class to find out which what the x,y coordinates of an agent are and what direction it is traveling in. When an agent makes a move it
    uses the class Actions to get the LegalActions and the successor states.
    The GameStateData holds the data about the instance of the game. It will be created by data from its predecessor state. It also is used to create
    the first GameState
    The Grid Class is a 2-dimensional array that holds information about all the objects(walls, capsules and food) and Agents(Pacman and ghosts) on the
    field.

C) The data structure "Stack" is best described by the metaphor "huge pile of dirty restaurant dishes", because when an object is taken out of a stack
   it will be the last object that was put in the stack.
   The data structure "Queue" is best described by the metaphor "roller coaster waiting line" because it will use the First In First Out principle.
   When you take an object out of a queue it will be the object that was in there for the longest time.
   The data structure "Priority Queue" is best described by the metaphor "Emergency Room Waiting Area" because when you take an object out of the
   Priority Queue it will be the object with the highest priority.
